Make a widget that can increase and decrease a number.
Check that the widget counter does not go below zero.
Add these features:
to set the counter back to 0.
to let the widget count in multiples.
Users should be able to choose the multiples for the widget to use

TDD (Test cases to consider):
should increment the counter by 1 when the plus button is clicked
should decrement the counter by 1 when the minus button is clicked
should not decrement the counter below 0 when the minus button is clicked
should reset the counter to 0 when the reset button is clicked
should increment the counter by the specified increment value when the plus button is clicked
should decrement the counter by the specified increment value when the minus button is clicked

Create an HTML file with a div element to contain the widget and two buttons, one for incrementing the counter and the other for decrementing it.
Add a label to display the current counter value.

Style the HTML elements with CSS to make the widget visually appealing.

Use JavaScript to implement the functionality of the widget.
Create a variable to hold the counter value and update it when the user clicks on the plus or minus button.
Check that the counter value does not go below zero.

Implement the reset functionality by adding another button that sets the counter value to zero when clicked.

Add the ability for the widget to increment in multiples by adding an input element where the user can enter the increment value.
Use JavaScript to get the value from the input and use it to update the counter when the plus button is clicked.

Test the widget thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
